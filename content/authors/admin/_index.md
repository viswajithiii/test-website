Hi there!

My name is Isha and I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford University. I study how AI-mediated platforms shape work, social life, and wellbeing, with particular attention to gender, accessibility, inequality, development, and culture in Majority World contexts. I have worked on a range of projects around these topics and others, with a variety of collaborators and teams across South Asia, UK, US and Sub-Saharan Africa. You can check out some of my projects [here](/#projects). 

After completing my PhD in Sociology from UC Irvine, I am currently working on a book based on my dissertation project, which examined the gender dynamics of platform work in India. Other ongoing projects record new forms of algorithmic management in beauty platforms, examine women's access to work in contemporary India, and analyze how Indian immigrant tech workers shape work cultures in Silicon Valley. I am deeply invested in applying historical-comparative and interdisciplinary perspectives to platform research, in order to assess and mitigate the growing harms of AI technologies.

Going forward, I am looking for jobs that let me combine academic research with industry impact, and am open to non-traditional teams and organizations. Please get in touch if you have openings!
